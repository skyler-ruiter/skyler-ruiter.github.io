## About Me

I am a senior at Grand Valley State University studying computer science with a minor in mathematics and employed as an undergraduate researcher for the Applied Computing Institute. Currently, I am researching methods and programs to facilitate biomedical research through data compression and machine learning. I’m also the president of the Computing Club of GVSU, leading dozens of students in gaining technical and interpersonal skills for the world of computing. When I’m not working on research, school, or club, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing soccer, reading, and mixing drinks.

I had not even considered research as an option going into my junior year of college, but I had received an offer for a research position with a new professor. After working with my mentor for a few months and the opportunity to work with other researchers, I knew that research was the right path for me. Since then, I have been enjoying my time conducting research and have only confirmed my decision to pursue self-improvement through doing the best research possible.

## About This Site

This website is a tool to help me learn and grow. One of the primary goals is for me to just have a space to write about academic topics and compare with others to help me improve my writing skills. I also use this website as a general landing point for my professional work as I want to show off my projects and skills on this website where I can. One of the ways in which I add to this website is by reading papers in computing and putting down my thoughts and questions about the paper. This is a way for me to gain a stronger backgroud in computing, help me get better at reading academic papers, and to start building a potential relationship with the authors I admire.

## About My Work

I currently conduct research for the [Applied Computing Institute (ACI)](https://www.gvsu.edu/aci/) of [Grand Valley State University (GVSU)](https://www.gvsu.edu/) as a resident and undergraduate researcher. 

**Projects:**
My first project for the ACI and first research project ever is the creation of a sparse matrix compression library called IVSparse. This was a library I developed in collaboration with my research partner Seth Wolfgang and other research Marc Tunnel. IVSparse is a library designed for the compression of redundant sparse data by adding value and index compression techniques to redundant data patterns. This results in two propriotary compression formats known as Value Compressed Sparse Column (VCSC) and Index and Value Compressed Sparse Column (IVCSC). The library is written in C++ and is designed to be used in a variety of applications. The library is currently in the process of being published and is currently a preprint while waiting for submission to the Data Compression Conference. The domains this project encompasses are data compression and high performance computing (HPC).

My second project has recently started and has included a number of more people to the project, growing to a team of around 5 students. The new project is Probabilistic Modeling of Genomics Data with Variational Autoencoders (VAE). I don't fully understand the scope of the project at present since it is still in the early stages of development but I will update this section as we progress. The goal or motivating example is to try and predict risk based on a persons genome and the drug doctors wish to prescribe to try and aim for an educated guess instead of a blind guess when traditional methods fail. The domains this project encompasses are high performance computing (HPC), deep learning, and bioinformatics.

**Research Interests:**
My academic and research interests are continually refined as I continue my education, but I am deeply invested in high-performance computing (HPC) and interdisciplinary research involving HPC. The field of HPC has many qualities that I value and find interesting, making it a pillar of my research interests. Firstly, I love to optimize; understanding a codebase or even a single section of code to find ways to optimize the code for specific applications brings me much enjoyment. The ability to leverage tradeoffs in an algorithm or method to glean some way to optimize further is a skill I want to gain a more intuitive understanding of as I grow as a researcher. An example of this is approximate computing, finding where an algorithm can be less precise but improve performance while still being a highly reliable algorithm. This paints a larger picture of my desire to push computing and algorithmic boundaries in the realm of HPC.

I am also highly interested in interdisciplinary research involving high-performance computing. This is partly due to my deep passion for learning since working with other academic disciplines, such as the biomedical field, gives me a look into their unique characteristics and culture. Working with other disciplines is an opportunity to grow and expand my horizons, as collecting more domain knowledge from varying fields assists in creating new research to push even more boundaries. Scientific computing is a fantastic example of such interdisciplinary research with HPC as it uses the computing power of HPC to solve scientific problems that are often non-computing related.

Lastly, I have gained a few interests due to the nature of my research projects,  data compression, and machine learning. My primary research project was building a data compression library for redundant sparse data. The ideas of interdisciplinary research and optimization are also significant to the topic of data compression, leading me to them during my project. Machine learning is a newly acquired research interest as I have started working with it for a new project. The incredible power that modern machine learning provides is awe-inspiring, and imagining the coming prospects of the field, especially in conjunction with HPC, thrills me for current and future projects.
