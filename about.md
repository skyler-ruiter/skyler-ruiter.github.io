## Hobbies

---

I love to adventure and explore new places with my significant other, such as light hiking and skiing, or adventuring into caves. I also enjoy playing video games, reading, cooking, and mixology. I have a passion for learning and trying new things, and I am always looking for new hobbies to try.

## Undergraduate

---

I grew up in Grand Haven, Michigan, and went to Grand Valley State University for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I initially intended to work in industy, but after joining a research project at the Applied Computing Institute of GVSU under the mentorhsip of Dr. Zachary DeBruine. I found a passion for research as we worked initially on matrix factorization and then moved onto sparse compression of single-cell data. On this new research project I gained a co-worker and friend in Seth Wolfgang, who I have continued working with into grad school, and another mentor Dr. Erin Carrier who helped me get into grad school.

## Graduate

---

After graduating from GVSU I took an internship over the summer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I worked on the E3SM atmospheric model, HOMME (High-Order Method Modeling Environment), and learned a lot about the challenges of working with large scale scientific computing. I then started my graduate studies at Indiana University Bloomington in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I am currently working on the FZ Project under the advisement of Dr. Fengguang Song. As I continue my studies as a PhD Student in Information Systems Engineering I hope to find more applications for my research and continue to work on the development of high performance compression algorithms.
