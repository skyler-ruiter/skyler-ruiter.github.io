~~~ Notes ~~~

= Section 3: Data and communication compression for multiprecision algorithms

- Section 3.1: Data Conversions
  - there are existing fast conversions between float and double in LAPACK
- Section 3.2: Data Compression
  - F64 -> F32 is lossy compression losing 8 decimal digits but CR is 2x
  - iterative refinement from [24,4,3] can use F32 casting to 4x speedup
    some F64 solvers in MAGMA
  - also used ZFP compression for lossy Compression
    - set to 4x CR for ZFP, essentially size of F16 with F32 accuracy
    - which can accelerate FFT up to 4x
- Section 3.2.1: Mixed-precision MPI
  - compression/mixed precision can acclerate MPI communication
  - using ZFP can also reduce communication time but not as much as F16
    - does still do 2x losing 8 digits, data sending is 4x faster but only
      2x after compression and decompression
- Section 3.3: Approximate Fast Fourier Transforms
  - when running multidimensiona FFTs on distributed gpu system (eg. 43 GPUs)
    99% of the time is spent in MPI communication so speedup here is basically
    total speedup
  - they developed heFFTe library
  - by utilizing fused compression + packing mpi calls there can be 4x speedup
    using F16
  - ~~~ current work on overlapping use of GPUs for comp/decomp with MPI communications ~~~
    - possible due to being very memory bound
  - there is a level of accuracy control to leverage
    - mixed precision can be better than pure low precision
    - can even tune mixed to be equivilent to F64
  - otherwise can split the data dynamically in half (leverage tensor cores)

= Section 4: Multiprecision Sparse Factorizations

- direct methods for sparse systems can benefit from lower precision formats:
  - perform expensive calculations in low precision and have a cheap fixup
    algorithm to recover the accuracy in a higher precision
  - 2 research directions: the factorization themselves and in the context of direct solvers

- Section 4.1: Multiprecision sparse LU/QR
